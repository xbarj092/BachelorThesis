  Strings:
  - Beware of kittens. They are hungry and will steal your food
  - Kittens can either see you or hear your steps
  - Here you can see how much noise you are making
  - When they are hungry for too long, they will starve to death
  - If they survive, they will mate, so be careful, as they can overpopulate quickly
  - Oh damn, you dont have any items that could help you. The more you walk, the
    louder you are and kittens will hear you.
